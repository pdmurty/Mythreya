<h4> About Mythreya </h4>
<p>
This application has used Swiss Ephemeris package as per
        GNU GPL software license terms. All planetary positions are computed using The Moshier Ephemeris.
        This is a semi-analytical approximation of the JPL planetary and lunar ephemerides DE404,
        developed by Steve Moshier. Its deviation from JPL is below 1 arc second with the planets
        and a few arc seconds with the moon. This may be sufficient accuracy for most purposes,
        since the moon moves 1 arc second in 2 time seconds and the sun 2.5 arc seconds in one minute.
        All panchang elements are computed using the planetary positions as obtained above. Hindhu festival
        events are determined using rules as stated in Dharama Sindhu / Nirnaya Sindhu. The author has taken utmost care to give all the
        details as accurately as possible. This softaware comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. The author of the
        software is not responsible for consequences direct or indirect that may arise by use of this software.
        We welcome all suggestions for improvements and make it more user friendly.

      </p>
      <h3>2. Required permission</h3>
      <p>
Due to platform limitation, Android 5.1 and lower device users will see an extra permission called "Identity", or "Accounts", requested by the app. This permission allows an app to:

      <p>
Identity/Acount permission is not required for Android 6 and above.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Collection of anonymous data for analytics</h3>
      <p>
While you are interacting with the app, anonymous information regarding your device might be collected for the purpose of crash reporting and usage monitoring related to the app. The information collected helps identify app defects and popular features, that would serve as guidelines for the app's future improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
